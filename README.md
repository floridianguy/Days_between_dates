This project was created in October 2018 and initially committed in
November 2018.

The title is Days Between Dates.

This was part of a an exercise from Udacity's Introduction to Computer
Science course.  The goal was to write code that takes any two dates
and calculates the number of days between them.  My solution differs
substantially from the one presented in the course.  This project
makes use of lists, dictionaries, while loops, and functions.

Below is a link to the Udacity course that inspired the project.
